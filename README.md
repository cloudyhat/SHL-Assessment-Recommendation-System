# SHL Assessment Recommendation System

This project implements an intelligent recommendation system that suggests relevant SHL assessments based on job descriptions or natural language queries. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered by embeddings and similarity search over SHL assessment data.

## Problem Statement

Given a natural language query or a job description, recommend up to 10 most relevant SHL assessments from the SHL product catalog. Each recommendation must include metadata such as description, duration, support info, and URL.
